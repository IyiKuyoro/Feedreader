## Feedreader :memo:

Feedreader is an RSS that displays feeds from *Udacity Blog*, *CSS Tricks*, *HTML5 Rocks* and *Linear Digressions*. The purpose of this application is to practice writing jasmine tests for a front-end web application.

# Getting Started
You can have a local copy by downloading the zipped folder:
  1) Unpack the files on your local machine
  2) Ensure that all the unpacked files are located in one folder
  3) Locate the `index.html` file and launch it with any browser
  
All the tests should pass when you run the application.
  
# Navigating the page.
Navigating the four different feeds is simple. Click the hamburger icon at the top left-hand side of the screen to display the menu. Then simply click on the feeds you would like to take a look at.
At the bottom of the page is a jasmine spec runner.
